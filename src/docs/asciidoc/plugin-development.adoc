=== Additional information
- You should read https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/ide-development-instance.html

=== Import SecHub IntelliJ plugin
- clone the git repository git@github.com:mercedes-benz/sechub-plugin-intellij.git
- open the repository as a project in IntelliJ

== Start the plugin in sandbox mode

=== Gradle variant
Open the gradle toolwindow and execute "Tasks->intellij->runIde"

Or execute `./gradlew runIde` from terminal.

== Development HowTos
=== IntelliJ Sources not available, only depcompiled
Open the IntelliJ class - now it is opened by the internal
decompiler. On the right top there is a button "Choose source".
Click on this. Now select the correct IntelliJ folder and search
for the correct subfolder (with a hash inside) - now select the source zip file for the installed/used version.

After this: **close** existing editor and open the class again.
Now you should the sources.

TIP: This comes very handy when you want to look for deprecated classes, e.g. inside `IconLoader`.
