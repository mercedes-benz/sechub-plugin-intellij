=== Import an existing SecHub report

by dragging a report file from the file explorer into the report table (marked as [.small]#1.# in figure [.small]#1# ).

=== Use call hierarchy view to traverse finding steps
Double click on an entry inside the report table (marked as [.small]#1.# in figure [.small]#1# ).

When you have done this, you will see the complete call hierarchy from entrypoint to data sink inside call hierarchy
tree marked as [.small]#2.# in overview picture.

Selecting an entry inside the call hierarchy will show the reported source code
(marked as [.small]#3.# in figure [.small]#1#) with details about its location
and open the editor, highlighting the reported line.

If you have already changed your code and the report location does no longer match 100% to the finding location, the
editor will still mark reported location - in this case please look at the origin reported source code and search for
the origin part. If the file cannot be found by plugin, no editor will be opened.
